This is the final project for GR 5205: Linear Regression Models with Professor Yisha Yao at Columbia University. We developed Python scripts to deconvolute noisy, blurred 2D images and applied hierarchical density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to separate object pixels from noise, enabling accurate dimension estimation without labeled data. This allowed us to simulate datasets of geometric shapes and demonstrate the methodâ€™s robustness for real-world applications such as medical imaging and remote sensing. This work was completed in collaboration with Jason Ye, Kei Ogawa, and Daniel Shi.
